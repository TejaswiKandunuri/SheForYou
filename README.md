# Project Description

Sustainable Shopping🛒🛍
Gen Z consumers are increasingly inclined towards sustainable, high-quality products. According to a report by First Insight, 73% of Gen Z consumers are willing to pay 10% more for sustainable products. Our project aims to harness this preference by predicting fashion trends that align with sustainable practices.
Social Shopping Integration.

Gen Z shoppers tend to trust influencers on platforms like Instagram and YouTube more than traditional companies. Our solution integrates social shopping by utilizing influencer data to identify and predict fashion trends, ensuring our fashion line resonates with Gen Z preferences.

Predicting future fashion trends for Gen Z is challenging due to their diverse and rapidly changing tastes.

These images will be showcased on social media and Myntra, where interactive features will gauge user interest and feedback.📝
